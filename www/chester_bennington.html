                <p>Chester Charles Bennington (Phoenix, March 20, 1976 â€“ Palos Verdes Estates, July 20, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician, best known as the frontman of the rock band Linkin Park and, between 2013 and 2015, also of Stone Temple Pilots, as well as his parallel project Dead by Sunrise.</p>
                <p>His powerful and emotional voice became a hallmark of Linkin Park's sound, capable of shifting from touching melodies to raw screams. Bennington openly struggled with mental health issues and addiction for much of his life, themes often reflected in the band's lyrics.</p>
                <p>In 2006, Bennington was ranked 46th on Hit Parader's list of the "Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time." His untimely passing left an irreplaceable void in the music world and among millions of fans.</p>
